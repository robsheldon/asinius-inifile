This is an ini-file-handling component for the [Asinius library](https://github.com/robsheldon/asinius-core).

## Status

Two classes are provided: ClassicIniFile, which is a wrapper for PHP's native parse_ini_file(), and ExtendedIniFile, which enables some nice-to-haves in the venerable old file format.
